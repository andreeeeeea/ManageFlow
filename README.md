# ManageFlow
 A C# and .NET web application where users can track their employees and create and delegate tasks to them.

 This project is actively being worked on.
#

To Do List: 
- ~~Add user authentification~~ DONE! \o/

~~For simplicity sake, I will assume the users signing up will be the managers. They will manually add in their employees and whatnot. 
Don't want to overengineer this so early on, so I will visit the idea of making it so that users can be either managers or employees later on.~~
Users can sign up and choose whether they're managers or employees. 
WORKING ON -> If an employee signs up using the same email that their manager used when adding the employee record, their account will be automatically linked to the employee record.

- ~~Add editing and deleting employees/tasks function~~

~~Wouldn't be a proper CRUD project without this part, eh?~~ DONE! \o/

- Expand on functionality.

 

- When properly done with the backend somewhat, focus a bit on the frontend. 

Won't spend too much time on the frontend, as this is mostly meant to be a backend project. Will probably search some templates online and modify them (and link them here!).
