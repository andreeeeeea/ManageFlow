### To Do List: 
- ~~Add user authentification~~ DONE! \o/

~~For simplicity sake, I will assume the users signing up will be the managers. They will manually add in their employees and whatnot. 
Don't want to overengineer this so early on, so I will visit the idea of making it so that users can be either managers or employees later on.~~
Users can sign up and choose whether they're managers or employees. If an employee signs up using the same email that their manager used when adding the employee record, their account will be automatically linked to the employee record.
- ~~Add editing and deleting employees/tasks function~~
~~Wouldn't be a proper CRUD project without this part, eh?~~ DONE! \o/
- Expand on functionality ---> Working on this.
- ~~When properly done with the backend somewhat, focus a bit on the frontend.~~ Finished on this, for now.
