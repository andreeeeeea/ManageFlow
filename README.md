# EmployeeManager
 A web application where users can track their employees and create and delegate tasks to them.

 Done mainly to experience first on making web app projects using C# and .NET (Blazor). Love it so far.

#

To Do List: 
- Add user authentification

For now, for simplicity sake, I will assume the users signing up will be the managers. They will manually add in their employees and whatnot. 
Don't want to overengineer this so early on, so I will visit the idea of making it so that users can be either managers or employees later on.

- Add editing and deleting employees/tasks function

Wouldn't be a proper CRUD project without this part, eh?

- When properly done with the backend somewhat, focus a bit on the frontend. 

Won't spend too much time on the frontend, as this is mostly meant to be a backend project. Will probably search some templates online and modify them (and link them here!).
